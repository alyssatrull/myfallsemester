            <h2>Who Are They?</h2>
            <p>Story time was Leslie King's favorite part of childhood. Turning 
            this passion into a career path, stories remain an important part of 
            her life. As both an instructor in the professional and technical writing 
            program and manager of communications for the Department of English, 
            she describes her career path simply as “words and pictures.” Her stories, 
            photos, and videos are widely published on VTx and she most recently served 
            as associate editor of Illuminations Magazine. For 10 years she has specialized 
            in higher education storytelling. As a fineart photographer and printmaker, 
            King exhibits her work in museums and galleries throughout the East Coast, 
            Louisiana, Texas, Canada, and Germany. </p>
