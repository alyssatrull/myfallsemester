            <h1>Intro to Professional and Technical Writing</h1>

            <h2>Course Description</h2>
            <p>provides a foundation in the theory and practice of professional and technical 
            writing. You will gain an understanding of genres that professional writers use 
            regularly (e.g., correspondence, proposals, fact sheets, reports). Equally, if not 
            more important, you will learn to analyze rhetorical situations and then, using those 
            analyses, write and design texts to meet the demands of those situations. In addition, 
            you will gain practical experience with collaborative project practices and project 
            management (planning, drafting, revising, editing, and distributing). By the end of 
            the course, you will have an overview of the roles and responsibilities 
            of professional and technical writers.</p>
